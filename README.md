# Document Scanning

A basic document scanner which can read the contents of a scanned document

Scan Images of Documents and read it's contents written in python.

I have used images of two bills.

What this python script does is identify the contents in it.

we can read what the bill has in it.

I made this on python 3.6 but i have updated it for python 3.7 too

Soo if you have pyhton 3.8 or higher or 3.6 or lower, it won't work
